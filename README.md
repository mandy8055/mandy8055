## 🎯 What I'm About

> *"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad."* - Cody (probably)

I'm that person who gets excited about clean code, elegant algorithms, and perfectly aligned divs. I spend my days building things with JavaScript/TypeScript and my nights pretending I understand monads (still working on it).

**Current Status:** Making the web a prettier place, one commit at a time ⚡

## 🎭 Plot Twist: I'm Not Just Code

**Day Job:** Architecting scalable web applications  
**Night Shift:** Conquering LeetCode problems like they owe me money  
**Weekends:** A mix of running, guitar riffs, and pretending my side projects will be done "soon"

**Fun Facts:**
- 🏃‍♂️ Run like I'm being chased by production bugs
- 🎸 Play guitar (badly, but enthusiastically)
- 🏊 Swim competitively (state medalist, no big deal 😎)
- 📖 Read self-help books while procrastinating on actual help
